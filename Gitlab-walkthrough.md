Boards are located inside of the issues tab(this will be where the tickets are)
In between sprints, we will add tickets keeping notes to talk about after each sprint.
- go to the issues tab in boards(will see all issues)
- create a new issue (top right corner)
- if clicked on the issue can edit the issue in the top right corner
*      activities will show how each user has interacted with each issue
- when creating a new issue (keep the title simple no description needed)
- leave assignee as unassigned until daily retro
- labels are how we put the issue to the board
*      leaving the issue's labels unassigned will drop them into the open table
- once the issue is on the board you can drag and drop the issue to another table


*in the Project information, you can create a high medium and low ticket
